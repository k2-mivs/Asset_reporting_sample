System Asset Inventory reporting

The CISO wants to understand the organization's system inventory.  A data repository has been created at https://github.com/k2-mivs/Asset_reporting_sample . 

2 sample data files one representing asset inventory and the other representing the system's list

	1. The asset inventory file has an ID field that has the Org and the System ID in one field. 
	2. We need asset reporting created to answer the following questions.
		a. How many operational systems does our organization have by FIPS 199 level. 
		b. Define count of assets by Org. Tell many orgs have no assets and tell me how many assets have no system assigned to it. 
		c. How many private ip addresses we are using. 
		d. Provide the count of assets by Vendor, by Operating System 
		e. Define quantity of assets are defined as GFE. GFE is defined as equipment using Windows 10 with a private IP address. 
	3. Requirements
		a. Produce 2 pages in Power Bi. 
			i. Page1: A visualization page answering the questions in section 2
			ii. Page2: A definitions page explaining any formulas or acronyms
		b. Our clients will need to be able to export this information into power point and will need to be able to filter based on Org, system and Fisma reportable systems. 
		c. Our clients has a style sheet defined on our github page. 
		d. We will need to see sample DAX and sample Power Query and excellent visualizations.
